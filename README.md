# orderly2-example

This repo exists so that we have something to clone in tooling around orderly2; notably [`packit-deploy`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/packit-deploy)

There is a set of outpack files that can be unpacked by running

```
./scripts/unpack-outpack
```

if you need to test against packits (rather than their sources).
